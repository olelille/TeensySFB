With a low altitude noise of merely 0.25m atfast conversion time, the BMP180 offers superior performance. The I2C interface allows for easysystem integration with a microcontroller.The BMP180 is based on piezo-resistive technology for EMC robustness, high accuracy and linearity aswell as long term stability.Key features:- Temperature measurement included- I2C interface- Fully calibrated- Pb-free, halogen-free and RoHS compliant,- MSL 1Basic specs:Pressure range: 300 to 1100hPa (+9000m to -500m relating to sea level)Supply voltage: 1.8 to 3.6V (VDD), 1.62V to 3.6V (VDDIO)Package: LGA package with metal lidSmall footprint: 3.6mm x 3.8mmSuper-flat: 0.93mm heightLow power: 5µA at 1 sample / sec. in standard modeLow noise: 0.06hPa (0.5m) in ultra low power mode, 0.02hPa (0.17m) advanced resolution modeTypical applications:- Enhancement of GPS navigation (dead-reckoning, slope detection, etc.)- In- and out-door navigation- Leisure and sports- Weather forecast- Vertical velocity indication (rise/sink speed)"
